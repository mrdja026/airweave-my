  - One‑day simulation runnable: simulate_day.sql (and one‑click simulate‑and‑export) executes Observe → Plan → Act → Log for the day.
  - Maintains state: employees, projects, events, actions, decisions in Postgres.
  - Observe → Plan → Act → Log cycle: executed and persisted (performed_actions, ceo_decisions) and visible via views.
  - ≥3 simulated actions: assign, reassign, email (plus EOD report generation).
  - Decisions + rationale: ceo_decisions with rationale; surfaced in UI (via direct decisions view) and in deliverables after sync.
  - End‑of‑day summary/report: EOD export script; UI prompts (with “Model Reasoning (concise)”) produce grounded summaries.
  - Logs/evidence: performed_actions_text, ceo_decisions_text, project_event_history_text, eod_deliverables_text are indexed and queryable.

  Partial (meets intent, can be tightened)

  - Constraints (time/capacity/cost): availability + schedule + planned‑hours are implemented and summarized; cost shows when rates exist. If
    project_assignments (rates) is absent, constraints are hours‑only (still acceptable, but not “cost”).
  - “Keep decisions within resource/budget constraints”: plans consider availability and deadline; budget enforcement is implicit (hours) rather
    than an explicit budget check. Adding a simple budget ceiling (e.g., daily cost cap when rates are present) would fully satisfy this.

  Not required / optional in the spec (and currently out of scope)

  - You satisfy the core ACs: a working, autonomous one‑day loop; state; actions; decisions; constraints; EOD with reasoning; and audit logs.
  - The only AC that’s “partial” is the “cost” aspect of constraints/budget when rates aren’t present. If you want to make this fully green:
      - Seed rates (project_assignments) once, or
      - Keep hours‑only but add a simple budget threshold and flag if planned_hours × default_rate exceeds it (no schema change needed).

  If you want, I can add:

  - A tiny seed for project_assignments (rates) so constraints always show cost.
  - A “budget check” step that flags over‑budget days in the constraints view and includes that line in the EOD.
